    question: "How does this work?",
    answer:
      "In Round 1, you'll be provided with 15 questions that you can view in the Questions tab. Once you click on the question, you can either choose to use the online editor or you can download the executable files to run the question's code locally. <br>In the editor, a set of instructions are provided for the format of the input. Based on the format, you can provide your own test cases and run the program to get an output. In this manner, you can decipher what the program is doing, and replicate the code that generates the correct output. <br>Once you’ve figured out your code, you can upload it, after which your code will be tested against the hidden test cases, and you will get points from 0 to 100 accordingly.",

Time Limit Exceeded<br>Your code took too long to produce an output. Check to see if you have no infinite loops, and try to improve the efficiency of your algorithm.<br><br>4. Compilation Error<br>Your uploaded code did not compile correctly. Recheck the code’s syntax!<br><br>5. Runtime Error<br>Your code threw a runtime error during execution.<br><br>6.
